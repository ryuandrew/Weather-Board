# Weather-Board

## Description

The Weather Board app will use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities and store data into `local storage`. The app is built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.


## User Story

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
